# Part 1: Connect and use your dev box

## Connect to your Dev Box
1. Open your browser and go to [devportal.microsoft.com](https://devportal.microsoft.com). Enter your credentials.
2. You should see a Dev Box in your developer portal. Click on ‘Connect via app’ to connect to your dev box.

*You will see a pop-up suggesting you [download](#) the Windows App.*

3. Follow those steps and download it from the App Store. Once installed, login into the Windows App to connect to your Dev Box from a Desktop Client.
 **Note:** you will need to sign into the Windows App with your username and password.
4. You can skip the Windows App tutorial as well.

6.Download the Dev Box VS Code extension (preview version) from [here](https://azure.github.io/dev-box/media/ms-devbox-2.0.0-preview.vsix) and install it in your **local** VS Code — **NOT** in the Dev Box you want to connect to.

7. Open Extensions view in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) and select the `...` icon on the top right corner.  
Choose **Install from VSIX...** and select the downloaded file.

Also make sure you have the latest version of the [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) extension pack installed.
